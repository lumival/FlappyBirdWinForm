# FlappyBirdWinForm
This is a flappy bird game made in windows form with C#

I followed a tutorial in order to learn how to create a small game.

Use the space bar key on the keyboard to make the bird go up and down.
The game will end if the bird comes close to the ground, top border/sky, or any pipes.
After your score hits 5 points, the speed of the pipes moving will increase.
